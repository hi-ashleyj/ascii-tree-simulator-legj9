# ASCII Tree Simulator  
Made for the Low Effort Game Jam 9: [https://itch.io/jam/low-effort-jam-9](https://itch.io/jam/low-effort-jam-9)  
  
## Controls  
Move Level - Left/Right Arrow
  
## Other info  
There was no theme but a friend made something to randomly generate these one at a time. I thought "hey, I could do that but make it scrollable"  
  
Tested and works on Chrome for Windows. Not tested anywhere else. Not mobile compatible  
  
Built using my own game engine for HTML5/Canvas  
  
## It's not polished  
I am aware. This is infact the point of the jam. This is a low effort testing scene, made in three ours with my single braincell in my pocket.  

## Maintainence?
Nope! That's it. I'm going to be archiving and leaving this game alone forever. That's why it's got "archive" at the top.
  
## Is there an itch.io link?  
[It only took like a year, but there is now](https://hi-ashleyj.itch.io/legj9-ascii-tree-simulator)
